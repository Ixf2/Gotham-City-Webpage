# Gotham City Universe Absolute

Welcome to the **Gotham City Universe Absolute** project! This is a web page that explores an alternate universe of Gotham City, showcasing its featured heroes, villains, and comics with a modern, card-centric (Bento Cards) design.

## 🌟 Features

This project is a single-page landing page that highlights the following:

* **Thematic Design:** Inspired by the DC Comics universe, with a focus on Gotham City and Batman, using a dark color palette with red accents.
* **Card Design (Bento Cards):** Attractive presentation of characters (Villains and Supers) and comics in a modular card layout.
* **Gotham City Section:** Information about the city and an illustrative map.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Header navigation menu for quick access to the main sections.
* **Suggestions Form:** An interactive section with a video background, allowing users to submit suggestions for new characters or comics.
* **Multimedia Resources:** Uses images for characters and comics, a video in the suggestions form, and a video in the footer.
* **Responsiveness:** (Implicitly structured to be responsive, based on CSS structure and mobile menu implementation).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5:** Semantic page structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling, including CSS variables (`:root`), Flexbox for layout, and visual effects like `backdrop-filter` (for blur).
* **JavaScript:** For interactive functionalities (referenced in `gotham-form.js` and `gotham-menu.js`, although the JS code was not provided).
* **Font Awesome:** Iconography for the menu, login, and social media links.
